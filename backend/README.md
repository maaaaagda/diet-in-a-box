# Diet In A Box Backend

## Requirements

-   Node.js **8+**
-   MongoDB **3.6+**
-   Redis **5.0+**

[API documentation](###api-documentation)  
[Postman API example collection](###postman-api-example-collection)  
If you want to test it don´t forget to change the server variable to:  
`https://api-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com`

Demo is also linked to a VueJS project that shows how this API can be integrated to a frontend that is able to consume an API.  
Repo is here: <https://github.com/davellanedam/vue-skeleton-mvp>  
Running demo is here: <https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com>

## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davellanedam/node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton.git ./myproject
```

### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompress to your desired directory

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd myproject
npm install
npm update
```

### Setting up environments (development or production)

1.  In the root this repository you will find a file named `.env.example`
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment (development or production)
5.  Upload the `.env` to your environment server(development or production)
6.  If you use the postman collection to try the endpoints, change value of the variable `server` on your environment to the url of your server, for development mode use <http://localhost:3000>

**IMPORTANT:** By default token expires in 3 days (4320 minutes set in .env.example). You can refresh token at endpoint GET /token. If everything it´s ok you will get a new token.

### Mailer

To ensure the deliverability of emails sent by this API, `Mailgun` is used for mailing users when they sign up, so if you want to use that feature go sign up at their website <https://www.mailgun.com>

If you want to try a different method it´s ok, I used <https://nodemailer.com> for this API and they have different transport methods like: smtp.

### i18n

Language is automatically detected from `Accept-Language` header on the request. So either you send locale manually on the request or your browser will send its default, if `Accept-Language` header is not sent then it will use `en` locale as default.

## How to run

### Database cleaning and seeding samples

There are 3 available commands for this: `fresh`, `clean` and `seed`.

```bash
npm run command
```

-   `fresh` cleans and then seeds the database with dynamic data.
-   `clean` cleans the database.
-   `seed` seeds the database with dynamic data.

### Running in development mode (lifting API server)

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
****************************
*    Starting Server
*    Port: 3000
*    NODE_ENV: development
*    Database: MongoDB
*    DB Connection: OK
****************************
```

### Running tests

It´s a good practice to do tests at your code, so a sample of how to do that in `mocha/chai` is also included in the `/test` directory

```bash
npm run test
```

### Formatting code

Format your code with prettier by typing:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Formatting markdown files

Format all your markdown files with remark by typing:

```bash
npm run remark
```

### Linting code

Lint your code with ESLint by typing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Postman API example collection

You can import the example collection to Postman. To import, click the import button located and select `postman-example.json` located within the root directory.

Go to `manage environments` to create environments for development, production, etc. On each of the environments you create you will need to:

1.  Create a new key `authToken` and within the `/login` request this value is automatically updated after a successfull login through a script located in the `tests` tab. Each time you make a request to the API it will send `Authorization` header with the `token` value in the request, you can check this on the headers of users or cities endpoints in the Postman example.

2.  Create a second key `server` with the url of your server, for development mode use <http://localhost:3000>

This is a REST API, so it works using the following HTTP methods:

-   GET (Read): Gets a list of items, or a single item
-   POST (Create): Creates an item
-   PATCH (Update): Updates an item
-   DELETE: Deletes an item

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/app/models/` and it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new routes

If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/app/routes/` and it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new controllers

When you create a new controller file, try to also create another file with validations. Ex. `countries.js` and `countries.validate.js`. An example of this is included in the repository.
